## Project Portfolio Overview
> Here's a list of my past work and projects in *data analytics, hedge fund activism, and fundamental equity research.* I'm passionate about using large datasets to discover interesting patterns, especially in financial markets. In terms of **equity research**, I mostly applied *value investing approaches* in analyzing the fundamental performance of small-cap companies. They have historically presented decent price appreciations in the past, and they usually receive less coverage from institutional investors or banks. Therefore, they serve as valuable hunting ground for (deep) value investors. Hope you enjoy reading them!
